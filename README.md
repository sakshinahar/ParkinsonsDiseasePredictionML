The objectives of the project are:
1.	To perform survey of research papers and analyse different machine learning algorithms and their role in predicting Parkinson’s disease.
2.	To obtain the voice and spiral dataset required to detect the Parkinson’s disease.
3.	Implementing various Machine Learning algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest, K-Neighbors, Decision tree and Convolutional neural Network to predict the presence or absence of the disease and analyze the results.
